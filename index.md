# Privacy Policy for Better Friend

**Last Updated: May 4, 2025**

## Introduction

Welcome to Better Friend ("we," "our," or "us"). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use our mobile application ("App"). By using Better Friend, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Information Collection and Use

### Microphone Access

Better Friend requests access to your device's microphone solely for the audio reactivity feature. When enabled, this feature processes audio data in real-time to create visual patterns that respond to sound. **All audio processing occurs locally on your device. We do not record, store, transmit, or share any audio data.**

### User-Generated Content

Content you create within Better Friend (patterns, animations, and exported media) is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this content unless you explicitly choose to share it outside the App.

### Usage Data

We may collect anonymous usage statistics to help improve the App's functionality. This information cannot be used to identify you personally and may include:
- App performance metrics
- Feature usage patterns
- Device information (type, operating system version)

## Data Storage and Security

All user data is stored locally on your device. We implement appropriate technical measures to protect your information, but please be aware that no security system is impenetrable.

## Third-Party Services

Our App may contain links to or utilize third-party services. These third parties have separate privacy policies, and we have no responsibility for their content or activities.

## Children's Privacy

Our App does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Changes become effective when posted on this page.

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your personal information. Since Better Friend primarily processes data locally on your device, most traditional data rights (access, correction, deletion) are managed through your device settings.
